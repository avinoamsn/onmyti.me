# TODOs for onmyti.me

### Project ideas, suggestions & TODOs

- Touch-up docs in the `usePersistentState` hook & c/p it into the custom hooks repo
- It would be cool if the background amber/orange dimmed with the evening/night (e.g. transition `bg-amber-200` -> `bg-amber-400`, or similar)
- Custom backgrounds? (Maybe different pastel colors)

### Bugs, features, suggestions

- Feature: config option to use barrel file pattern for components (etc.) - it appears this would be required to use the current dir import pattern w/ TS
- Suggestion: Generate scaffold components inside a `<MODEL>Scaffold` dir
