# TODOs for onmyti.me

### Project ideas, suggestions & TODOs

- Arrow interaction currently both scrolls the textarea & the page, there should be a way to differentiate the two different actions (perhaps a setting optionally disabling arrow scroll if the user would prefer using arrows to navigate entry input text)
- Replace ASCII carriage return w/ inline SVG (currently saved in `src/assets`)
- Touch-up docs in the `usePersistentState` hook & c/p it into the custom hooks repo
- It would be cool if the background amber/orange dimmed with the evening/night (e.g. transition `bg-amber-200` -> `bg-amber-400`, or similar)
- Custom backgrounds? (Maybe different pastel colors)

### Bugs, features, suggestions

- Feature: config option to use barrel file pattern for components (etc.) - it appears this would be required to use the current dir import pattern w/ TS
- Suggestion: Generate scaffold components inside a `<MODEL>Scaffold` dir
