# TODOs for onmyti.me

### Project ideas, suggestions & TODOs

- Arrow interaction currently both scrolls the textarea & the page, there should be a way to differentiate the two different actions (perhaps a setting optionally disabling arrow scroll if the user would prefer using arrows to navigate entry input text)
- Replace ASCII carriage return w/ inline SVG (currently saved in `src/assets`)
- multiple formatting options for the clock
  - maybe even an analog clock?
- Touch-up docs in the `usePersistentState` hook & c/p it into the custom hooks repo
- It would be cool if the background amber/orange dimmed with the evening/night (e.g. transition `bg-amber-200` -> `bg-amber-400`, or similar)
- Custom backgrounds? (Maybe different pastel colors)
- improve the resolver logic for the optional `from`/`to` fields in the entries query (it's more verbose than it likely needs to be due to some prisma limitations)

### Bugs, features, suggestions

- Feature: config option to use barrel file pattern for components (etc.) - it appears this would be required to use the current dir import pattern w/ TS
- Suggestion: Generate scaffold components inside a `<MODEL>Scaffold` dir
- Bug: Generated model services don't extend the `...WhereUniqueInput` interface where applicable (e.g. in the `Update<Model>ModelArgs` interface, where both the input & id are required for the `update<Model>` function below â€“ see `srvices/entries/entry` for more detail).
